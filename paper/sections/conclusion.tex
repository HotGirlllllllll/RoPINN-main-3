\section{CONCLUSIONS}
This paper presents RoPINN-ResFF, an architecture-level enhancement of RoPINN that combines residual MLP blocks and Fourier feature embedding. Under a fixed 1000-iteration budget with multi-seed evaluation, the method delivers statistically significant gains on reaction (11 paired seeds, p=0.00098 for both L1 and L2), directional gains on wave, and a reproducible failure mode on convection. Additional reaction budget-sensitivity runs at 3000 and 5000 iterations further show stable advantages over baseline, indicating that the observed gain is not limited to an early-training regime.

The key message is that backbone design can materially strengthen region-optimized PINNs, but the benefit is PDE-dependent. Future work will focus on convection-aware inductive bias, balanced multi-seed evaluation across tasks, and compute-fair comparisons to further improve robustness and external validity.
