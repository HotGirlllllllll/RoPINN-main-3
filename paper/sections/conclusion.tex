\section{CONCLUSIONS}
This paper presents RoPINN-ResFF, an architecture-level enhancement of RoPINN that combines residual MLP blocks, Fourier feature embedding, and optional curriculum scheduling. Under a fixed 1000-iteration budget with multi-seed evaluation, the method consistently improves reaction and wave while exposing a reproducible failure mode on convection.

The key message is that backbone design can materially strengthen region-optimized PINNs, but the benefit is PDE-dependent. Future work will focus on convection-aware inductive bias and broader multi-seed evaluation to further improve robustness and external validity.
